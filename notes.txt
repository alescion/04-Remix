REMIX:
- meters is not a good unit as some chess boards are bigger than others
- allow user to filter by color and redraw graph w/ bars in ascending order
- clicking on a bar will modify a gauge
- gauge will show: of the games where selected piece was moved, what was the win %
- if no pieces selected, show overall win %
